We've been planning this session for a while. While everyone's been hacking away crazy products, it's important to take a minute to think whether users need this. 

There's no one better to take us through this than [Dharmesh Ba](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dharmeshba/). Dharmesh is the founder of Business Hero and has been writing [India Notes](https://newsletter.theindianotes.com/) which is an amazing piece of work around user insights. 

If you've missed the session or if you'd like to go through it again, here's the session video - https://youtu.be/aFR17zYN_QI

Here's the notes from the meeting: 

Key Takeaways

- Aim for 12-15 in-depth interviews to start seeing patterns emerge
- Focus on understanding people's lives and problems, not just pushing your product idea
- Build a culture of customer insights across the organization, not just in research teams

Importance of User Research
- Easy to build products now, so figuring out what to build is key challenge
- Nobody cares about your product unless it solves a real problem
- Goal is to avoid building something nobody wants
- User research helps uncover truth about customer needs

Conducting User Interviews
- Semi-structured conversations, not rigid surveys
- Prepare interview guide with intro, questions, conclusion
- Listen 90% of time, ask probing "why" questions
- Don't talk about your product idea, focus on their life/problems
- Take detailed notes, record if possible
- Aim for 45-60 min conversations that feel effortless

Analyzing Research Data
- Look for patterns after 12-15 interviews
- Don't obsess over finding one absolute truth
- Goal is getting closer to understanding users, not perfect data
- Clean and organize data, but do synthesis/analysis yourself

Building Research Culture
- Democratize research skills across organization
- Create channels for all employees to share customer insights
- Engage with frontline staff insights, don't dismiss them

Challenges and Tips
- Recruiting participants takes effort, leverage networks
- Compensate participants' time, but avoid cash payments
- Be aware of cultural nuances and power dynamics
- Practice getting past surface-level problems to deeper insights

Next Steps
- Dharmesh to share sample interview guide template
- Video and notes to be posted on YouTube and emailed to attendees
- Attendees encouraged to attend future sessions and share on social media
