**Introduction to RAG**
Hey, folks, happy Saturday. In this session, [Pavan Mantha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kameshwara-pavan-kumar-mantha-91678b21/) from [Orbcomm](https://www.orbcomm.com/) takes us through the an advanced session on how to implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation. This is a follow up session to our [Foundational RAG session](https://www.appliedai.club/webinars/ai-rag-technical-foundation). We highly recommend you go through that first.

The notebook and architecture presented in the session are available here - [repo](https://github.com/pavanjava/rag_sessions/tree/main/advanced_rag)

üîë Key Takeaways
- Advanced RAG techniques like hypothetical document embedding, context enrichment, and fusion retrieval significantly improve retrieval accuracy.
- Agentic RAG leverages autonomous agents across different RAG stages (query rewriting, retrieval, response generation).
- Basic RAG is easy to set up, but tuning and evaluation are where the real challenge lies.
- Local LLMs and embeddings help reduce cloud costs while maintaining flexibility.

üìö Topics Covered
üß† Advanced RAG Techniques
- Hypothetical Document Embedding: Generate possible answers and retrieve relevant documents against them.
- Context Enrichment: Add surrounding context to improve grounding.
- Fusion Retrieval: Combine dense (e.g. vector-based) and sparse (e.g. BM25) methods.
- Ensemble LLMs: Use multiple models to cross-validate and refine outputs.
- Agentic RAG: Deploy agents to manage different tasks in the RAG pipeline.

üõ†Ô∏è Practical Implementation
- Used LlamaIndex, Qdrant, and local LLMs to build a basic RAG pipeline.
- Extended RAG with hypothetical document embedding and fusion retrieval.
- Discussed stages: document loading, embedding, storage, and query engine creation.
- Stressed on hyperparameter tuning for retrieval performance.

üìä RAG Evaluation & Optimization
- Building a reliable ground truth dataset remains hard.
- Need to track accuracy, latency, and cost metrics.
- Observability tools can monitor token usage and system behavior.

üöÄ Production Considerations
- Trade-off between speed and accuracy (especially with Agentic RAG).
- Local models cut cost, while cloud APIs offer scalability and features.
- No one-size-fits-all ‚Äî success depends on experimentation and domain knowledge.

Here's the entire recording of the session.
