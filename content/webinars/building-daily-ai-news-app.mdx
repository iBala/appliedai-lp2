# Building a Daily AI News App: A Step-by-Step Guide

In this session of the Applied AI Club series, we built a simple yet powerful AI news summarizer app from scratch. In just about 15 minutes, we went from ideation to a working prototype that accepts a topic, pulls in the latest news from the web, and uses an LLM to summarize the content. Below is a detailed breakdown of the process along with the key code blocks and explanations to help you reproduce the project.

## 1. Setting Up the Environment

Before diving into the code, we prepared our development environment. Here are the key steps:

### Creating a Project Folder
Start by creating an empty folder for the project. This is where all files and code will reside.

### Using a Notebook for Prototyping
We used a Python notebook (e.g., via Cursor or Jupyter) for interactive development. Notebooks allow you to test logic step by step, making debugging easier.

### Creating a Virtual Environment
To keep dependencies isolated, we ran:

```bash
python3 -m venv news_env
source news_env/bin/activate
```

This command creates and activates a virtual environment dedicated to our news summarizer project.

### Installing Dependencies
Once the virtual environment is active, install required packages:

```bash
pip install openai requests python-dotenv
```

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: Always load API keys and sensitive data from a separate .env file. This not only keeps your code clean but also secures your credentials.

## 2. Defining the Project Objective with Markdown

In the notebook, our very first markdown cell outlined the app's objective:

```markdown
### Daily News Summarizer App

This application takes a user-provided topic, fetches news articles from the last 24 hours, and then uses a language model to summarize the key points. The output will highlight the top three most important items along with explanations on why they matter.
```

This markdown cell sets the context for the project and helps both the developer and any collaborating AI agent understand the goal before writing any code.

## 3. Importing Dependencies and Setting Up API Keys

The first code cell imports all necessary libraries and loads environment variables:

```python
import os
import requests
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load API keys from .env file
load_dotenv()
OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
SERP_API_KEY = os.getenv("SERP_API_KEY")
```

What's happening here?
- **Environment Variables**: The dotenv package loads API keys from a .env file to keep them secure.
- **Library Imports**: Modules like requests help us make HTTP calls to fetch news data, and os is used to handle environment variables.

## 4. Fetching News Articles with the Google Search API

The next step is to collect news articles. A dedicated function is created for this purpose:

```python
def search_news(topic, max_articles=5):
    """
    Use the SERP API (powered by Google) to search for news articles related to the topic.
    """
    search_url = "https://serpapi.com/search"
    params = {
        "q": topic,
        "engine": "google",
        "tbm": "nws",
        "api_key": SERP_API_KEY,
        "num": max_articles,
        "tbs": "qdr:d"  # search within the last day
    }
    response = requests.get(search_url, params=params)
    results = response.json()
    # Extract URLs from results
    articles = [result['link'] for result in results.get("news_results", [])]
    return articles

# Example usage:
topic = input("Enter the topic you're interested in: ")
articles = search_news(topic, max_articles=5)
print("Found articles:", articles)
```

Explanation:
- The function builds a query for the SERP API to return news results (using parameters like "tbm": "nws" for news).
- We limit the search to the past 24 hours using the tbs parameter.
- Finally, the function extracts the article URLs from the API response.

## 5. Processing Articles to Extract Content

Once the URLs are obtained, we need to fetch and process the article content:

```python
def process_article(url):
    """
    Fetch and process the content of a news article from a given URL.
    (For simplicity, this example just returns a placeholder text.)
    """
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            # Here, you would parse the HTML and extract the main content.
            # For demonstration, we assume the response text is the content.
            return response.text[:500]  # returning first 500 characters as summary content
        else:
            return ""
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching article {url}: {e}")
        return ""

# Process all articles
article_contents = [process_article(url) for url in articles]
```

Explanation:
- **Error Handling**: The function includes error handling in case an article fails to load.
- **Content Extraction**: In a real application, you'd parse the HTML to extract just the article text (using libraries like BeautifulSoup). Here, we simplify by taking a snippet of the response text.

## 6. Summarizing the Articles Using a Language Model

Next, we integrate an LLM to summarize the fetched news content:

```python
import openai

def summarize_articles(articles_content, topic, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    """
    Summarizes the aggregated content from multiple articles.
    Returns the top three important items along with their explanations.
    """
    prompt = (
        f"Based on the following articles about '{topic}', "
        "provide a summary that includes the top three most important items and why they matter.\n\n"
    )
    for i, content in enumerate(articles_content, start=1):
        prompt += f"Article {i}: {content}\n\n"
    
    prompt += "Please list the top three items with explanations."
    
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY,
    )
    
    summary = response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
    return summary

# Generate summary
news_summary = summarize_articles(article_contents, topic)
print("News Summary:")
print(news_summary)
```

Explanation:
- **Prompt Construction**: The prompt combines content from each article and instructs the LLM to extract the top three key items.
- **Model Choice**: The code uses GPT-3.5-turbo by default (though you can easily switch to another model, like GPT-4).
- **API Call**: The call to openai.ChatCompletion.create sends the prompt and retrieves a summarized response.

## 7. Displaying the Results

Finally, the summarized news is printed or can be displayed in the notebook's output:

```python
def display_summary(summary):
    """
    Prints the summary in a clear, readable format.
    """
    print("----- Daily News Summary -----")
    print(summary)
    print("------------------------------")

display_summary(news_summary)
```

This simple display function ensures that the summary is neatly outputted to the terminal or notebook.

## 8. Migrating the Notebook into a Modular Python Project

Toward the end of the session, we discussed converting our notebook into a full-fledged Python project:

### Creating a Project Structure

```
newsaroo/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
â”œâ”€â”€ config.py
â”œâ”€â”€ search.py
â”œâ”€â”€ content.py
â”œâ”€â”€ summarization.py
â”œâ”€â”€ utils.py
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test_app.py
â””â”€â”€ .env
```

### Modularizing Code

Each functionality (search, content extraction, summarization) gets its own module. This makes the code easier to maintain and test.

### Using a Main Script

The main.py script ties all the modules together:

```python
from search import search_news
from content import process_article
from summarization import summarize_articles
from utils import display_summary

def main():
    topic = input("Enter your news topic: ")
    articles = search_news(topic, max_articles=5)
    articles_content = [process_article(url) for url in articles]
    summary = summarize_articles(articles_content, topic)
    display_summary(summary)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Why Modularize?

- **Easier Maintenance**: Breaking the code into modules (e.g., one file for search logic, one for summarization) helps manage changes and isolate bugs.
- **Scalability**: As the app grows (for example, adding a web front end or integration with messaging platforms like WhatsApp), a modular structure simplifies expansion.

## Conclusion

In this webinar session, we walked through creating a daily news summarizer app from ideation to a working prototype. By:
- Setting up a dedicated environment,
- Using a notebook for rapid prototyping,
- Integrating a news search API,
- Processing and summarizing content with an LLM, and
- Migrating the prototype into a modular Python project,

we demonstrated a practical, step-by-step approach to building a complete AI application.
