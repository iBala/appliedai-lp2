Here's the notes from the meeting: 

Meeting Purpose
Explore how to use generative AI for data analytics, covering different levels of implementation and key principles.

Key Takeaways
  - Five levels of Gen AI for analytics: 1) Basic data upload, 2) AI-assisted tools, 3) Analytics assistants, 4) Analytics copilots, 5) Autonomous agents
  - Data governance and privacy are critical concerns when using Gen AI with enterprise data
  - Implementing Gen AI for analytics requires careful consideration of data preparation, metadata, and context provision to LLMs
  - Future developments in autonomous agents and fine-tuned models will further enhance analytics capabilities

Topics
Overview of Analytics Workflow
  - Typical workflow: Data preparation (production DBs, data warehouses, data lakes) → Analytics process (BI tools, ad hoc analysis) → Publishing reports/dashboards
  - Data governance becoming increasingly important as organizations grow and data complexity increases

Level 0: Traditional Analytics Tools
  - Current tools: Tableau, Looker, Metabase, Superset, Jupyter notebooks, SQL queries in BI tools
  - Excel still widely used for data analysis, transformation, and visualization

Level 1: Basic Gen AI Integration
  - Uploading CSV files directly to ChatGPT or similar tools for analysis
  - Major concern: Data privacy and governance issues when sharing sensitive data with third-party AI services

Level 2: AI-Assisted Analytics Tools
  - Using existing analytics tools with AI assistance (e.g., Google Colab, Jupyter notebooks with AI extensions)
  - Allows non-technical users to perform analysis using natural language prompts
  - Example demonstrated: Using Colab to analyze sales data with AI-generated code

Level 3: Analytics Assistants
  - Purpose-built AI assistants for data exploration and analysis
  - Example tools: Julius.ai, custom-built chatbots connected to databases
  - Provides more control over data access and processing compared to Level 1

Level 4: Analytics Copilots
  - Integration of analytics capabilities into existing communication tools (e.g., Slack, WhatsApp)
  - Allows asynchronous, passive querying and analysis of data
  - Useful for busy executives and managers who need quick insights

Level 5: Autonomous Agents
  - AI agents that proactively analyze data, identify patterns, and generate insights
  - Utilizes historical context, user preferences, and relevance assessment to provide valuable information without explicit queries

Data Preparation and Governance
  - Importance of proper data structuring, labeling, and metadata creation
  - Need for systems to identify relevant tables, columns, and data samples for each query
  - Potential use of knowledge graphs or other frameworks to help AI understand data relationships

Challenges and Considerations
  - Handling multiple interconnected datasets and complex data relationships
  - Ensuring accuracy and preventing hallucinations when dealing with large datasets
  - Balancing between providing enough context and minimizing token usage/processing time

Future Developments
  - Fine-tuned models specifically for analytics tasks (e.g., Claude's finance-focused model)
  - Improved integration of AI with existing BI and visualization tools
  - Enhanced autonomous agents with better understanding of business context and user needs

Next Steps
  - Explore fine-tuned models for specific analytics use cases
  - Implement robust data governance practices when using Gen AI for analytics
  - Consider developing custom solutions for metadata management and context provision to LLMs
  - Investigate ways to leverage query logs and user feedback to improve AI-powered analytics over time
  - For those interested, review the code for the custom analytics assistant (to be shared via email)
