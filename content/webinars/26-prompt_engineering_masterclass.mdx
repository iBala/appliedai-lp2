Hey folks! We're at session number 26. Half a year of running sessions in Applied AI club. This session convers the basics of how to think, understand and execute prompts.

The session is conducted by [Aditya Ramakrishnan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adityaramakrishnan/). Aditya is a Product Marketing Leader, currently heading PMM at Reo.dev.

Here's the notes from the meeting: 

Meeting Purpose
Aditya Ramakrishnan delivers an in-depth session on advanced prompt engineering techniques and LLM behavior for the Uplight AI Club's 25th or 26th meeting.

Key Takeaways
  - Prompt engineering is closer to programming than natural language; LLMs are statistical language prediction engines, not human-like AI
  - LLMs have compute budgets and process instructions sequentially; understanding this helps create more effective prompts
  - Breaking complex tasks into subtasks and providing clear, structured instructions significantly improves LLM output quality
  - Using techniques like cheat sheets, save points, and JSON specifications can make prompts more deterministic and reduce hallucinations

Topics
Uplight AI Club Introduction
  - Club run by Bala and Praveen for ~6 months, with ~1,500 members
  - Weekly expert sessions on Saturdays at 10 AM, available on YouTube
  - Recently started study groups for more involved learning

Prompt Engineering Basics
  - Use examples, design for simplicity and unambiguity
  - RICE FACT framework: Role, Instruction, Context, Example, Format, Aim, Constraints, Tone
  - Output length and JSON format are helpful for structured outputs
  - Various prompting techniques exist (e.g., one-shot, multi-shot, chain of thought)

LLM Behavior and Processing
  - LLMs are probabilistic, not deterministic; goal is to maximize probability of desired output
  - They process tasks by breaking them into subtasks, similar to human brains but more rigidly
  - Compute budget affects instruction processing and task execution
  - Context window size doesn't equal processing capacity

Task Difficulty for LLMs
  - Basic recall and local reasoning are easy
  - Systems thinking, creativity, and multi-step tasks are more difficult
  - Understanding task difficulty helps in breaking down complex prompts

Practical Prompt Engineering
  - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks
  - Create cheat sheets and scoring mechanisms for reusable components
  - Use tree of thought for exploring multiple solution paths
  - Implement save points to manage context and reduce compute load

Image Generation Example
  - Demonstrated a custom GPT (GraphicsMaker) that generates on-brand images
  - Uses JSON specifications to make image generation more deterministic
  - Removes guesswork from style, color, font, etc., based on pre-defined rules

Next Steps
  - Share the presentation deck and Notion document with attendees
  - Attendees to practice breaking down complex tasks into subtasks for LLMs
  - Focus on understanding how LLMs process instructions and break tasks into subtasks
  - Experiment with creating cheat sheets and JSON specifications for deterministic outputs
  - Continue learning and improving prompt engineering skills through practice and analysis
