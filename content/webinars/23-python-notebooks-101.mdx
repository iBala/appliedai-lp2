Hey folks, we've been doing a lot of theory sessions for a while now. We though we'll do a hands on session for a change. 

The session is conducted by [Bala Panneerselvam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/balakumaranpanneerselvam/). Bala is a founding member of Applied AI club, founder of ZORP with 17+ years in technology and product.

If you've missed the session or if you'd like to go through it again, here's the session video - [https://youtu.be/2-8CmjksxFc](https://youtu.be/2-8CmjksxFc)

Here's the notes from the meeting: 

Meeting Purpose
Introduce non-technical professionals to Python notebooks for AI and data analysis.

Key Takeaways
  - Python notebooks provide an accessible way to work with large datasets and perform AI/ML tasks without extensive coding knowledge
  - Google Colab offers free cloud-based Python notebooks with pre-installed libraries and GPU/TPU access
  - Pandas is a key library for data manipulation; matplotlib for visualization
  - OpenAI API integration allows leveraging LLMs for data analysis within notebooks

Topics
Introduction to Python Notebooks
  - Python is a programming language commonly used for data analysis
  - Notebooks allow writing and executing code in discrete cells
  - Google Colab provides free cloud-based Python notebooks
  - Advantages: No local setup required, pre-installed libraries, GPU/TPU access

Working with Data using Pandas
  - Imported Pandas library as 'pd'
  - Loaded Excel file using pd.read_excel()
  - Created new columns with calculations (e.g. revenue = quantity * unit_price)
  - Demonstrated grouping, sorting, and pivoting data
  - Visualized data using matplotlib library

Integrating OpenAI API

  - Installed OpenAI library and set up API key
  - Sampled 2000 rows from dataset to stay within token limits
  - Demonstrated prompting GPT model for open-ended data analysis
  - Discussed handling conversation context and token limitations

AI/ML Concepts Discussion
  - Explained how ChatGPT maintains conversation context
  - Discussed methods for handling context window limitations (truncation, summarization)
  - Covered concepts of persistent storage and efficient retrieval of past conversations

Next Steps
  - Participants to practice using Python notebooks independently
  - Explore more advanced data analysis and ML techniques in notebooks
  - Consider joining the AI club for future sessions on related topics

Here's the entire recording of the session.
