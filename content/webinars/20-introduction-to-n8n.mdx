Below is a summary of Applied AI Club's session on Introduction to n8n with guest speaker Karthikeyan. 

Meeting Purpose
Demonstrate how to use N8N, an open-source workflow automation platform with AI capabilities, to create a LinkedIn post generator.

Key Takeaways
- N8N is a low-code automation tool that allows easy integration of AI models and various APIs
- The demo showcased building a workflow to generate LinkedIn posts with AI-created images
- N8N offers both cloud-hosted and self-hosted options, with pricing based on workflow executions rather than individual node runs
- For complex workflows, N8N can be more cost-effective than alternatives like Zapier or Make

Topics
Introduction to N8N
- Open-source workflow automation platform with native AI capabilities
- Low-code tool written in TypeScript, running on Node.js
- Over 150 integrations available
- Offers 14-day free trial for cloud-hosted version
- Open-source version available under fair-code license with some usage restrictions

N8N Basics
- Workflows built using "nodes" as basic building blocks
- Triggers initiate workflows (e.g., chat, form, webhook)
- Nodes perform actions and can be connected to create complex workflows
- User interface allows easy visualization of inputs/outputs between nodes

Demo: LinkedIn Post Generator Workflow
1.  Form Trigger: Collects topic input
2.  AI Agent (Post Writer): Generates post content using OpenAI GPT model
3.  AI Agent (Prompt Writer): Creates image prompt based on post content
4.  OpenAI Image Generation: Uses DALL-E 3 to create image from prompt
5.  HTTP Request: Uploads generated image to ImageBB for storage
6.  Human-in-the-Loop: Sends email for approval using Gmail integration
7.  Switch Node: Handles approval/rejection logic
8.  LinkedIn Integration: Posts approved content to LinkedIn

N8N Features and Capabilities
- Integration with various APIs and services (e.g., OpenAI, LinkedIn, Gmail)
- Built-in AI agents with customizable prompts and models
- HTTP request handling for external API calls
- Conditional logic using switch nodes
- Human-in-the-loop processes for approval workflows

Hosting and Pricing Considerations
- Cloud-hosted version: Easier setup, includes AI features, pricing based on workflow executions
- Self-hosted version: More control, potential cost savings, requires technical setup
- N8N can be more cost-effective for complex workflows compared to Zapier or Make

Next Steps
- Explore N8N's documentation for more advanced features and integrations
- Consider use cases within your organization for workflow automation
- Evaluate cloud-hosted vs. self-hosted options based on security and cost requirements
- Sign up for Applied AI Club (www.applieday.club) for future sessions and discussions
