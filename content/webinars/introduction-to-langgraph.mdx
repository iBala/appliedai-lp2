**Langgraph - An Introduction**

Hey, Bala again. In this session, we went through Langgraph. Langgraph is a powerful framework to build AI agents capable of handling really complex tasks. This is one of the production ready frameworks we have seen for building AI agents. It's fairly complex compared to other frameworks but also very robust. 

**Quick notes on Langgraph**
- Build complex working agents. Usable by live users
- Actively maintained. They make frequent changes, so we need to actively follow them.
- They do a lot of breaking changes. So be very careful while upgrading and using them in production.
- Fairly complex and used for advanced use cases.

Here's the entire recording of the session.
