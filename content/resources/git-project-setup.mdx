# Git Guide for Product Managers

## 1. What is Git and Why is it Helpful?

### What is Git?
Git is a **version control system (VCS)** that allows multiple people to work on a project without overwriting each other's work. It keeps track of changes, enables collaboration, and ensures code stability by allowing rollbacks to previous versions if needed.

### Why is Git Useful for Product Managers?
- **Code Collaboration:** Helps PMs collaborate with developers and understand the development workflow.
- **Change Tracking:** Keeps track of modifications to codebases.
- **Safe Experimentation:** Allows developers to try new features without affecting the main code.
- **Version Control:** Ensures that past versions of the project can be accessed if needed.

## 2. How to Set Up a Git Account

To use Git with remote repositories (such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket), follow these steps:

1. **Choose a Git Service** (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.).
2. **Create an Account**:
   - Visit [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign up.
   - Follow the instructions to verify your email and set up two-factor authentication for security.
3. **Set Up an SSH Key (Recommended for Authentication)**:
    This set up helps your computer authenticate with the remote repository without entering your username and password every time you push or pull.
   - Open your terminal (Mac/Linux) or Git Bash (Windows).
   - Run:
     ```sh
     ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"
     ```
   - Copy the key to your clipboard:
     ```sh
     cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
     ```
   - Add this key to your GitHub account under **Settings â†’ SSH and GPG keys**.

## 3. How to Set Up Git in Your Local System and Authenticate with the Remote

### Install Git

#### Windows
1. Download and install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
2. Open **Git Bash** and verify installation:
   ```sh
   git --version
   ```

#### Mac (via Homebrew)
```sh
brew install git
```

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

### Configure Git Locally
Once Git is installed, set up your user details:
```sh
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
```

### Authenticate with Remote Repository
#### Using HTTPS (Password-Based)
- When pushing code, GitHub will prompt you to enter your username and personal access token.

#### Using SSH (Recommended)
1. Ensure SSH key is added to GitHub.
2. Test the connection:
   ```sh
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```
   If successful, you should see a message like: `Hi username! You've successfully authenticated.`

## 4. How to Set Up a New Repository

### Create a Repository on GitHub
1. Go to GitHub and click **New Repository**.
2. Name your repo and choose **Public** or **Private**.
3. Initialize with a README (optional) and click **Create Repository**.

### Set Up a Local Repository
1. Open your terminal and navigate to your project folder:
   ```sh
   cd path/to/your/project
   ```
2. Initialize Git:
   ```sh
   git init
   ```
3. Connect the local repo to GitHub:
   ```sh
   git remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/repository-name.git
   ```
4. Add and commit files:
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```
5. Push code to GitHub:
   ```sh
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## 5. How to Clone an Existing Repository and Switch to Your Git Account

### Clone a Repository
To work on an existing project:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:username/repository-name.git
```
Or, using HTTPS:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
```

### Switch to Your Git Account
If you've cloned a repo that belongs to someone else and want to push changes under your account:
```sh
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:your-username/repository-name.git
```

### Verify the Remote URL
```sh
git remote -v
```
You should see:
```sh
origin  git@github.com:your-username/repository-name.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:your-username/repository-name.git (push)
```
