# Guide to Working with Pip and Poetry

## Overview
Pip and Poetry are both tools used for managing Python packages and virtual environments. Pip is the standard package manager for Python, while Poetry is a modern alternative that simplifies dependency management and project packaging.

### When to Use What?
- **Use Pip** if you want a simple way to install packages and manage dependencies manually.
- **Use Poetry** if you want an all-in-one solution for dependency management, virtual environments, and project packaging.

## Working with Pip
### 1. Installing Pip
Most Python installations come with Pip pre-installed. To check if you have Pip:
```sh
pip --version
```
If not installed, install it with:
```sh
python -m ensurepip --default-pip
```

### 2. Setting Up a Virtual Environment
Creating a virtual environment ensures that dependencies remain isolated from system-wide Python packages.

#### Create a Virtual Environment
```sh
python -m venv myenv
```

#### Activate the Virtual Environment
- **Windows**:
  ```sh
  myenv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **Mac/Linux**:
  ```sh
  source myenv/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. Loading the Virtual Environment in VS Code
1. Open VS Code.
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` and type **Python: Select Interpreter**.
3. Choose the Python interpreter from your virtual environment.

### 4. Adding and Removing Packages
#### Install a Package
```sh
pip install package_name
```

#### Uninstall a Package
```sh
pip uninstall package_name
```

#### Save Installed Packages to a File
```sh
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

#### Install Packages from a Requirements File
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Working with Poetry
### 1. Installing Poetry
Poetry can be installed using:
```sh
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```
Verify installation:
```sh
poetry --version
```

### 2. Setting Up a Virtual Environment
#### Create a New Project
```sh
poetry new myproject
cd myproject
```

#### Initialize Poetry in an Existing Project
```sh
poetry init
```

#### Activate the Virtual Environment
```sh
poetry shell
```

### 3. Loading the Virtual Environment in VS Code
1. Open VS Code.
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` and type **Python: Select Interpreter**.
3. Select the Poetry environment interpreter.

### 4. Adding and Removing Packages
#### Install a Package
```sh
poetry add package_name
```

#### Remove a Package
```sh
poetry remove package_name
```

#### Install Dependencies from `pyproject.toml`
```sh
poetry install
```

## Summary
- **Pip** is simpler and best for quick setups or small projects.
- **Poetry** is more structured and useful for managing dependencies in larger projects.
- Both tools help create virtual environments and manage dependencies efficiently.

Choose based on your project needs!
