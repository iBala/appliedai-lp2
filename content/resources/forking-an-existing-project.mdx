## 1. How to Fork a Repository
Forking a repository allows you to create a personal copy of someone elseâ€™s repository on GitHub, so you can modify and contribute back to the original project.

### Steps to Fork a Repository
1. **Go to the repository** you want to fork on GitHub.
2. Click the **Fork** button in the top right corner.
3. GitHub will create a copy of the repository under your account.

## 2. How to Clone a Forked Repository
After forking, you need to clone the repository to your local system to start making changes.

### Clone the Repository Using SSH (Recommended)
```sh
git clone git@github.com:your-username/repository-name.git
```

### Clone the Repository Using HTTPS
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
```

Navigate into the repository:
```sh
cd repository-name
```

## 3. Open the Repository in VS Code
Once the repository is cloned, you can open it in VS Code.

```sh
code .
```

This will launch **Visual Studio Code** with the repository opened.

## 4. Set Up Your GitHub SSH Keys in Local System
To authenticate your GitHub operations without entering credentials every time, refer to the guide here: [Git Project Setup Guide](http://appliedai.club/resources/git-project-setup)

## 5. Update Remote URL After Forking
When you fork a repository and clone it, the `.git` file may still be connected to the original user's repository. You need to update it to point to your fork.

### Check the Current Remote URL
```sh
git remote -v
```
You might see something like this:
```sh
origin  git@github.com:original-user/repository-name.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:original-user/repository-name.git (push)
```

### Update Remote to Point to Your Fork
1. Remove the existing remote:
   ```sh
   git remote remove origin
   ```
2. Add your own fork as the new origin:
   ```sh
   git remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/repository-name.git
   ```
3. Verify the change:
   ```sh
   git remote -v
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```sh
   origin  git@github.com:your-username/repository-name.git (fetch)
   origin  git@github.com:your-username/repository-name.git (push)
   ```
4. Push your local changes to your forked repository:
   ```sh
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## 6. Link Your Fork to the Original Repository (Upstream)
If you want to sync your fork with the original repository:

1. Add the original repository as upstream:
   ```sh
   git remote add upstream git@github.com:original-owner/repository-name.git
   ```

2. Verify remotes:
   ```sh
   git remote -v
   ```

3. Fetch updates from upstream:
   ```sh
   git fetch upstream
   ```

4. Merge upstream changes into your fork:
   ```sh
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

Now your fork is up to date with the original repository.

This guide provides a structured approach for forking, cloning, setting up authentication, updating remote repositories, and managing GitHub accounts locally.
